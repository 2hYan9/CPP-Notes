# C++-Primer-Plus-notes
The reading notes of the *C++ Primer Plus*  
reader of this notes require some C foundation,  
and this notes may be helpful for those who get in touch with OOP(object-oriented programing) for the first time.  
### Some Basic Knowledge of the C++  
The file "C++ Primer Plus I.md" mainly introduce some basic knowledge of C++, containing these following contents:
- [CH00](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20I.md#ch00): Some knowledge about complation process
- [CH01](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20I.md#ch01): OOP concept
- [CH02](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20I.md#ch02): A brief introduction about function definition and namespace in C++
- [CH03](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20I.md#ch03): Basic variable types and the *const* identifier 
- [CH04](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20I.md#ch04): some complex types, new & delete operator, and storage types  
### More Advanced Freature of C++
The file "C++ Primer Plus II.md" talks about some features of the C++. Contains these following contents:
- [CH05](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20II.md#ch05): Read input by 'cin' object and loop, structure traverse a range in a loop structure and clock() function  
- [CH06](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20II.md#ch06): Some simple file I/O cases
- [CH07](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20II.md#ch07): Take array or pointer as arguement in Function
- [CH08](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20II.md#ch08): Some advanced knowledge about the function in C++
- [CH09](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20II.md#ch09): The storage model in C++, and some details about namespace
### Classes in C++
The file "C++ Primer Plus III.md" is mainly about the C++ classes:
- [CH10](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20III.md#ch10): Some basic knowledge about C++ classes
- [CH11](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20III.md#ch11): Operator reloading(friendship) & type conversion in C++ classes
- [CH12](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20III.md#ch12): Dynamic memory allocation in C++ classes
- [CH13](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20III.md#ch13): Inheritance for C++ classes, virtual member function and Abstract bases class
- [CH14](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20III.md#ch14): Talking about the "has-a" relationship, mutiple inheritance and class template
