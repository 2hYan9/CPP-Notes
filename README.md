# C++-Primer-Plus-notes
The reading notes of the *C++ Primer Plus*  
reader of this notes require some C foundation,  
and this notes may be helpful for those who get in touch with OOP(object-oriented programing) for the first time.  
Note: All these files are written in Chinese.  
### Some Basic Knowledge of the C++  
The file "C++ Primer Plus I.md" mainly introduce some basic knowledge of C++, containing these following contents:
- [CH00](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20I.md#ch00): Some knowledge about complation process
- [CH01](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20I.md#ch01): OOP concept
- [CH02](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20I.md#ch02): A brief introduction about function definition and namespace in C++
- [CH03](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20I.md#ch03): Basic variable types and the *const* identifier 
- [CH04](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20I.md#ch04): Some complex types, new & delete operator, and storage types  
### More Advanced Freature of C++
The file "C++ Primer Plus II.md" talks about some features of the C++. Contains these following contents:
- [CH05](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20II.md#ch05): Read input by 'cin' object and loop, structure traverse a range in a loop structure and clock() function  
- [CH06](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20II.md#ch06): Some simple file I/O cases
- [CH07](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20II.md#ch07): Take array or pointer as arguement in Function
- [CH08](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20II.md#ch08): Some advanced knowledge about the function in C++
- [CH09](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20II.md#ch09): The storage model in C++, and some details about namespace
### Classes in C++
The file "C++ Primer Plus III.md" is mainly about the C++ classes:
- [CH10](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20III.md#ch10): Some basic knowledge about C++ classes
- [CH11](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20III.md#ch11): Operator reloading(friendship) & type conversion in C++ classes
- [CH12](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20III.md#ch12): Dynamic memory allocation in C++ classes
- [CH13](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20III.md#ch13): Inheritance for C++ classes, virtual member function and Abstract bases class
- [CH14](./C++%20Primer%20Plus.%20III.md#ch14): Talking about the "has-a" relationship, mutiple inheritance and class template
  
### Extension I: Multiple-Thread Programing in C++  
Some concept are introduced to explain how to realize mutiple-thread programming in C++ in the file named "Extension I: Mutiple-Thread Programming in C++", and the contents of this file are listed below:  
- [create mutiple threads](./Extension%20I:%20Mutiple-Thread%20Programming%20in%20C++.md#create_thread): Introduce the "pthread.h" library, which provides the procedural method to realize mutiple-thread programming.  
- [thread class](./Extension%20I:%20Mutiple-Thread%20Programming%20in%20C++.md#thread_class): The thread class are introduced to realize the mutiple-thread programming in a object-oriented method.
  
### Extension II: C++ Network Programming  
- [Introduction](./Extension%20II:%20C++%20Network%20Programming.md#introduction): Some concepts about the network programming and the scoket programming.  
- [Socket Programming](./Extension%20II:%20C++%20Network%20Programming.md#socket): Introdution to socket programming.  
- [Implementation](./Extension%20II:%20C++%20Network%20Programming.md#implementation): An example of socket programming.  
  
### Extension III: Introduction to Docker
