# C++-Primer-Plus-notes
The reading notes of the *C++ Primer Plus*  
reader of this notes require some C foundation,  
and this notes may be helpful for those who get in touch with OOP(object-oriented programing) for the first time.  
The file "C++ Primer Plus I.md" mainly introduce some basic knowledge of C++, containing these following contents:
